# Libraries and command-line utilities for geospatial data processing/analysis in Python #

This package offers Python classes and functions as well as command line tools to work with both geospatial raster and vector datasets. It is built upon the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) bindings, and so in a single command can import any geo-referenced dataset that is understood by GDAL/OGR, complete with all geo-referencing information and various helper functions.
