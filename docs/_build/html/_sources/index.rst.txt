GeoUtils
========

Libraries and command-line utilities for geospatial data processing/analysis in Python
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This package offers Python classes and functions to work with both geospatial raster and vector datasets. It is built upon the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) bindings, and so in a single command can import any geo-referenced dataset that is understood by GDAL/OGR, complete with all geo-referencing information and various helper functions.
